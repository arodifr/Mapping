# Source Code and Data
Source code and data to generate analyzes of the article "Agree to disagree: reliability of facial feature size descriptions across expertise levels". 

# Manuscript
This study evaluates whether observers with different expertise describe the size of internal facial features consistently (interobserver agreement), how closely qualitative facial descriptions align with two quantitative ground truths(accuracy), and whether targeted training can improve the reliability of these descriptions.  

Ground truths
A ground truth dataset provides a reference for assessing the accuracy of qualitative descriptions by comparing them to quantitative “ideal” values. There are different approaches to measuring these values, but following the psychological and soft biometrics literature, we focus on two: 

•	Categorical ground truth (CaGT): Internal facial traits (eyes, nose, mouth) are classified by size relative to their position within the population distribution. 
•	Comparative ground truth (CompGT): Internal facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) are classified relative to the size of the face outline. For example, the ratio between nose size and face size determines if the nose is categorized as small, medium, or large.

Sensitivity
To identify which size categories (small, medium, or large) were effectively classified, we calculated the true positive rate (sensitivity). This represents the proportion of qualitative descriptions that correctly match the quantitative classification provided by the ground truth.
